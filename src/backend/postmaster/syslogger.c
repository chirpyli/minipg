 * syslogger.c
 *
 * The system logger (syslogger) appeared in Postgres 8.0. It catches all
 * stderr output from the postmaster, backends, and other subprocesses
 * by redirecting to a pipe, and writes it to a set of logfiles.
 * It's possible to have size and age limits for the logfile configured
 * in postgresql.conf. If these limits are reached or passed, the
 * current logfile is closed and a new one is created (rotated).
 * The logfiles are stored in a subdirectory (configurable in
 * postgresql.conf), using a user-selectable naming scheme.

 * length, the pid of the sending process, and a flag to indicate if it is
 * the last chunk in a message. Incomplete chunks are saved until we read some
 * more, and non-final chunks are accumulated until we get the final chunk.
 *
 * All of this is to avoid 2 problems:
 * . partial messages being written to logfiles (messes rotation), and
 * . messages from different backends being interleaved (messages garbled).
 *
 * Any non-protocol messages are written out directly. These should only come
 * from non-PostgreSQL sources, however (e.g. third party libraries writing to
 * stderr).
 *
 * logbuffer is the data input buffer, and *bytes_in_logbuffer is the number
 * of bytes present.  On exit, any not-yet-eaten data is left-justified in
